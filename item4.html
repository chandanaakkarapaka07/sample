    <h4>3 . Computer Science Concepts :-</h4>
    <dl>
        <ol><dt>computer science :</dt>
        <dd>Computer science terms are words and phrases that refer to specific topics or uses in the industry. When studying computer science, students often learn key terms they may encounter in their careers. Computer scientists use these terms frequently when communicating with each other or explaining their work to other colleagues.</dd>
        <dt>Analog:</dt>
        <dd>Analog technology relies on methods other than number processing to perform a function.</dd>
        <dt>Application:</dt>
        <dd>An application, often shortened to app, is a series of codes that allow specific tasks to happen. Applications can be on mobile devices, desktop computers and other electronic devices</dd>
        
        <dt>Array:</dt>
        <dd>Array refers to a set of similar data that saves in a sequential form. When a computer program searches for certain information, it can pull up an array, which includes any similar data that might be useful.</dd>
        <dt>BIOS:</dt>
        <dd>This abbreviation stands for basic input/output system. It's a platform that allows a computer to operate software found on a hard disk drive. When a computer turns on, it relies on the BIOS to operate.</dd>
        <dt>Binary digit:</dt>
        <dd>A binary digit, or bit, is the smallest information piece a computer can use. A bit is either a one or a zero, as these two digits make up the language computers use to process information and operate. </dd>
        <dt>Bug</dt>
        <dd>A bug is an error in the programming of software or an application. These errors can cause problems for the end user. When looking for and resolving bugs, computer scientists and developers might refer to the process as fixing bugs or applying fixes.</dd>
        <dt>Code:</dt>
        <dd>Code is another term for the programming languages used to edit, create and manage computer applications and programs. Experienced developers and computer scientists often learn multiple coding languages, as each has its own uses and applications.</dd>
        <dt>IDE:</dt>
        <dd>IDE stands for integrated development environment. It's a programming system that includes multiple programming tools. These tools can include source code editing, debugging and syntax highlighting. Using the IDE can deliver a more integrated platform for developers to use.</dd
